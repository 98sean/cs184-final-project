		<p>
		Each team will also be required to share a 1-2 minute final project video online. We strongly encourage you to take the time to polish your video and use the time to clearly highlight your most beautiful and compelling results, explain your technical approach at a high level and in an engaging way, and to explain what you learned and why future students should be interested to pursue a similar project.
		</p>

		<p>
		Every group member should be present / speak within this video.
		</p>

		<p>
		Teams selected as Showcase Projects (see below) will have their video, and only their video, appear on a class webpage recognizing the Showcase Projects. This further underscores the importance and visibility of these videos.
		</p>




			
		<h2>Abstract</h2>
				
		<p>
		A paragraph summary of the entire project.
		</p>



			
		<h2>Technical approach</h2>
				
		<p>
		A 1-2 page summary of your technical approach, techniques used, algorithms implemented, etc. (use references to papers or other resources for further detail). Highlight how your approach varied from the references used (did you implement a subset, or did you change or enhance anything), the unique decisions you made and why.
		</p>

		<p>
		A description of problems encountered and how you tackled them.
		</p>

		<p>
		A description of lessons learned.
		</p>




			
		<h2>Results</h2>
				
		<p>
		Your final images, animations, video of your system (whichever is relevant). You can include results that you think show off what you built but that you did not have time to go over on presentation day.
		</p>

		<p>
		Please include in your final deliverable a small clip, gif, movie, or animation of your teamâ€™s output for the final showcase.
